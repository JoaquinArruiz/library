# Library

A library prorotype

You can test it at: [Library: Live Page](https://joaquinarruiz.github.io/library/)

-----
#### Process and Some Thoughts:
I started from the logic part so I can design the book class,how to add it to the library and how to show it in the html, then worked with the aesthetic in the css. Had some small issues in the process like adding the delete button logic (had to learn how to use indexOf)

I learned a lot of js during this project.

-----
#### Known Issues:   
- Need to add more validations via JS   
- Change the script so it uses prototype to deletes/modify books instead of merge it all inside the book class
